MWS is a simple package designed to efficiently manage and oversee multiple **TiddlyWiki** instances seamlessly.

## Quick Start

First, install the package globally:

```bash
npm i -g @tecfancy/mws
```

Then, run the following command to start the server:

```bash
mws start
```

This will start the server on port 4236. You can access the server by visiting `http://localhost:4236` in your browser.

Use the following command to stop the server:

```bash
mws stop
```

_More features are coming soon, stay tuned ;-)_
